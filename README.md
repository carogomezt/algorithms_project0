## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this python scripts you need to install a Python version major than 3, in my local environment I used [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/).

In your terminal run the script with the following command:
```
$ python Task0.py
```
