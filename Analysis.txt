# Task0.py

The complexity of the functions print_first_record and print_last_record are O(1), because it only tries to get one element of a list.

# Task1.py

The complexity of the function get_phone_numbers is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the data list and we need to iterate over all of the elements of the list, and the complexity of the function count_different_numbers is O(1) as it only gets the length of the set.

# Task2.py

The complexity of the function print_longest_phone_call_time is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the data and we need to iterate over all of the elements of the list.

# Task3.py

The complexity of the function get_area_codes_and_prefixes is O(n log n) due to the usage of the sorted function and the complexity of get_percentage_of_area_calls is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the data and we need to iterate over all of the elements of the list.

# Task4.py

The complexity of get_telephone_marketing_numbers is O(n log n) due to the usage of the sorted function.
